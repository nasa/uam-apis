        The set of log data fulfilling this standard's Logging requirements.

        For X4, the server can support a maximum payload size of about 1.5MB. The 
        array limits identified in this model are intended to support that
        maximum size.

        If the total log set is larger than the identified array limits, multiple submissions 
        for a given operational intent, each under the size limit, may be performed. Data 
        should not be duplicated in a given property array between submissions.
