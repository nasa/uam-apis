  description: |- 
    Resources Planning Service Sequence Scheduling (RPS-SS) Interface. RPS-SS provides Earliest Spaced Time of Arrival (ESTA) for each resource along trajectory given resource constraints, like spacing, overtake rules, etc. between aircraft at resource. If needed, adjust ESTAs within 4-D trajectory so aircraft arriving at entry, exit, crossing or merge resource, within controlled airspace, do not violate constraints.

        Request service to check timings in 4-D trajectory against given resource constraint information, like spacing, overtake rules, etc. between aircraft at resource. If needed, adjust Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at waypoints within given 4-D trajectory so aircraft arriving at entry, exit, crossing or merge resource, within controlled airspace, do not violate constraints.

        Factors like aircraft speed, altitude, etc. may be needed to determine resource availability. Minimum delay of arrival time at a resource needs to satisfy spacing criteria for that resource. Spacing should be an actual usable slot, not just delay required to follow aircraft to make room; thus, should consider leading and trailing spacing between aircraft. Return 4-D trajectory, with or without adjusted timings, and one of these scheduling outcomes:
        
            - FEASIBLE_AS_IS means timings in operation's 4-D trajectory were not changed.
            - FEASIBLE_WITH_CHANGE means timings in operation's 4-D trajectory were changed.
            - INFEASIBLE means unable to adjust operation's 4-D trajectory even by changing timings would still not satisfy resource constraints.

      description: |-
        A USS is presumed to be in the Unknown state absent indication otherwise by a USS with
        availability arbitration scope.  Upon determination via availability arbitration, a USS is
        Down when it does not respond appropriately, and a Down USS may not perform the following
        operations in the DSS:
          * Create an operational intent in the Accepted or Activated states
          * Modify an operational intent whose new or unchanged state is Accepted or Activated
          * Delete an operational intent
        A USS in the Unknown state possesses all the capabilities, within the DSS, of a USS in the
        Normal state.

        The create or update request for this operational intent reference must include a Key containing all OVNs for
        all relevant Entities.
        'Activated': Operational intent is in active use; see standard text for more details.
        The create or update request for this operational intent reference must include a Key containing all OVNs for
        all relevant Entities.
        'Nonconforming': This Operation is not conforming to its operational intent per the Community Based Rules (CBR). 
        The create or update request for this operational intent may omit a Key 
        in this case because the operational intent is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.
        'Contingent': UA is considered unrecoverable unable to conform with its coordinate operational intent; see
        standard text for more details. 
        This state must transition to Ended.
        The create or update request for
        this operational intent may omit a Key in this case because the operational intent is being adjusted as flown 
        and cannot necessarily deconflict.
