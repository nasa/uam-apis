  version: 2.0.1
  description: |-
    Interface definitions between two Providers of Services UAM (PSU)
    PSU functionality includes sharing details of flight operational intents and constraints.
    Note: Unless otherwise specified, fields specified in a message but not declared in the API must be ignored.
    Whenever a object-type field may be omitted, it may also be set to null for the same effect.
 
    Note: Version 0.3.17 Commit ed1eac6 of the ASTM UTM API was used as starting point for editing this API.
    Property and Schema names where not changed from 'USS' to 'PSU' to support common models with the DSS
    API.

      description: |-
        Authorization from, or on behalf of, an authorization authority.  This authority will issue access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, publish to all providers the public key for verifying that signature, and implement standard OAuth server discovery mechanisms as described in RFC 8414.
        The following fields must be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued by this authority:
        * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
        * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
        * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
        * `scope`, with a string composed of a space-separated list of strings indicating the scopes granted, per RFC 6749.
        * `jti`, according to RFC 7519.
        Following the principle of least privilege, only one of the scopes enumerated in this document should be granted in a single token (though other scopes may accompany it).  The tokens granted by this authority must protect against reuse of received tokens to impersonate the sender to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or other means).
        When using the `aud` claim to protect against the reuse of received tokens, and absent guidance on behalf of the competent authority to the contrary, the JWT `aud` claim requested by the client must be included in each access token and must contain the fully qualified domain name of the URL the access token will be used to access.  For example, if a PSU were querying the endpoint at https://dss.example.com:8888/rid/v2/dss/identification_service_areas, the access token included in the request should specify `"aud": "dss.example.com"`.
        Clients must provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.

        The PSU hosting this endpoint returns the details (and reference) of an
        operational intent it manages.  While the PSU has a pending request to change the
        operational intent in the DSS, the PSU should report the most recent version the
        PSU knows was accepted by the DSS.  So, before a PSU receives a response
        to create an operational intent reference in the DSS, it should return 404 if
        queried for that operational intent at this endpoint.
