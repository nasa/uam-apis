              \ AND FLIGHT RULES Subpart C—Equipment, Instrument, and Certificate\
              \ Requirements §91.227   Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast\
              \ (ADS-B) Out equipment performance requirements.\n(a) Definitions.\
              \ For the purposes of this section:\n\n  ADS-B Out is a function of\
              \ an aircraft's onboard avionics that periodically\n  broadcasts the\
              \ aircraft's state vector (3-dimensional position and\n  3-dimensional\
              \ velocity) and other required information as described in this\n  section.\n\
              \n  Navigation Accuracy Category for Position (NACP) specifies the accuracy\
              \ of\n  a reported aircraft's position, as defined in TSO-C166b and\
              \ TSO-C154c.\n\n  Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity (NACV) specifies\
              \ the accuracy of\n  a reported aircraft's velocity, as defined in TSO-C166b\
              \ and TSO-C154c.\n\n  Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) specifies\
              \ an integrity containment\n  radius around an aircraft's reported position,\
              \ as defined in TSO-C166b and\n  TSO-C154c.\n\n  Position Source refers\
              \ to the equipment installed onboard an aircraft used\n  to process\
              \ and provide aircraft position (for example, latitude, longitude,\n\
              \  and velocity) information.\n\n  Source Integrity Level (SIL) indicates\
              \ the probability of the reported\n  horizontal position exceeding the\
              \ containment radius defined by the NIC on\n  a per sample or per hour\
              \ basis, as defined in TSO-C166b and TSO-C154c.\n\n  System Design Assurance\
              \ (SDA) indicates the probability of an aircraft\n  malfunction causing\
              \ false or misleading information to be transmitted, as\n  defined in\
              \ TSO-C166b and TSO-C154c.\n\n  Total latency is the total time between\
              \ when the position is measured and\n  when the position is transmitted\
              \ by the aircraft.\n\n  Uncompensated latency is the time for which\
              \ the aircraft does not\n  compensate for latency.\n\n(b) 1090 MHz ES\
              \ and UAT Broadcast Links and Power Requirements—\n\n  (1) Aircraft\
              \ operating in Class A airspace must have equipment installed\n  that\
              \ meets the antenna and power output requirements of Class A1, A1S,\
              \ A2,\n  A3, B1S, or B1 equipment as defined in TSO-C166b, Extended\
              \ Squitter\n  Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and\
              \ Traffic Information\n  Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) Equipment Operating\
              \ on the Radio Frequency of\n  1090 Megahertz (MHz).\n\n  (2) Aircraft\
              \ operating in airspace designated for ADS-B Out, but outside of\n \

              \ Class A1H, A1S, A2, A3, B1S, or B1 equipment as defined in\n     \
              \ TSO-C154c, Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) Automatic Dependent\n\
              \      Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Equipment Operating on the Frequency\

              \ advisory is in effect;\n\n  (7) An indication of the Mode 3/A transponder\
              \ code specified by ATC;\n\n  (8) An indication of the aircraft's call\
