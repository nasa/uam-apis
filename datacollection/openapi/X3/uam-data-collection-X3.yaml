          This model captures performance and interoperability data for a PSU.
          Since only failure case data is included in the PSU network 'Report'
          model, it is important to have PSUs self report on nominal elements.
          This information may inform future performance requirements and
          forensics of certain incidents. This may be an initial model that will
          be required operationally in terms of a PSUs need to log interactions
