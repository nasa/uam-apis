    This file contains the core UAM models as OpenAPI 3.0 compliant definitions.
    Some key caveats when using/referencing this API:
      1. The API on its own is insufficeint to develop a USS or other UAM
      component.  For example, the USS Specification is needed to understand
      how and when to use the various endpoints and provides more details on
      security features that cannot be captured in the API docs.
      2. There is not a unified time synchronization approach in UAM currently.
      As such, times provided from one server MUST NOT be validated against each other.
      For example, if a sending server states that a data element
      was sent at 10:00:23, but the receiving server thinks it is currently
      10:00:22, the receiving server must not reject the data submission.  As
      we develop and roll out the time synchronization scheme for the USS
      Network, we will add appropriate validation requirements to the API
      documentation.
      3. On the contrary, times must be validated for consistency within a
      given data submission.  For example, if a server states that it sends
      a data instance at 10:00:23 and one of the other data elements states
      that a measurement was performed at 10:00:24, then the receiving server
      must reject that data submission. Some of these checks are explictly
      stated in the descriptions below. If you recognize any such checks that
      are not documented, please submit an issue report on github.
      4. These token SUBJECT validations are required for security.
      For PUT Operation to modify an existing operation, the token SUBJECT claim upon modification MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial Operation.
      For PUT Message associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Message MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency messages.
      For PUT Position associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Position MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed only if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency position reports.

    uuid:
      description: >-
        Currently, this is a UUID version 4.  These UUIDs have a well-defined
        regular expression.  However, beyond meeting the regular expression,
        there is an expectation that the numbers are generated appropriately in
        terms of the approach to psuedo-random number generation.  More details
        in the USS Specification document in this regard.

        UUIDs are used in several models and serve as primary keys in many
        cases.

        In all cases, unless otherwised specified, UUIDs are generated by a USS
        (or FIMS) prior to sending to another USS (or FIMS). Thus one entity
        does not add data elements (like a UUID primary key) to data originating
        from another entity.

        If ordering or sorting is required, the sort order is lexicographic as
        defined in RFC4122:

        UUIDs, as defined in this document, can also be ordered
        lexicographically.  For a pair of UUIDs, the first one follows the
        second if the most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is
        greater for the first UUID.  The second precedes the first if the most
        significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for the second
        UUID.
