    This file contains the core UTM models as OpenAPI 2.0 compliant definitions.
    Some key caveats when using/referencing this API:
      1. The API on its own is insufficeint to develop a USS or other UTM
      component.  For example, the USS Specification is needed to understand
      how and when to use the various endpoints and provides more details on
      security features that cannot be captured in the API docs.
      2. There is not a unified time synchronization approach in UTM currently.
      As such, times provided from one server MUST NOT be validated against each other.
      For example, if a sending server states that a data element
      was sent at 10:00:23, but the receiving server thinks it is currently
      10:00:22, the receiving server must not reject the data submission.  As
      we develop and roll out the time synchronization scheme for the USS
      Network, we will add appropriate validation requirements to the API
      documentation.
      3. On the contrary, times must be validated for consistency within a
      given data submission.  For example, if a server states that it sends
      a data instance at 10:00:23 and one of the other data elements states
      that a measurement was performed at 10:00:24, then the receiving server
      must reject that data submission. Some of these checks are explictly
      stated in the descriptions below. If you recognize any such checks that
      are not documented, please submit an issue report on github.
      4. These token SUBJECT validations are required for security.
      For PUT Operation to modify an existing operation, the token SUBJECT claim upon modification MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial Operation.
      For PUT Message associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Message MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency messages.
      For PUT Position associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Position MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed only if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency position reports.
