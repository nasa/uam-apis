    This file contains the core UTM models as OpenAPI 2.0 compliant definitions.

    Some key caveats when using/referencing this API:
      1. The API on its own is insufficeint to develop a USS or other UTM
      component.  For example, the USS Specification is needed to understand
      how and when to use the various endpoints and provides more details on
      security features that cannot be captured in the API docs.
      2. There is not a unified time synchronization approach in UTM currently.
      As such, times provided from one server MUST NOT be validated against each other.
      For example, if a sending server states that a data element
      was sent at 10:00:23, but the receiving server thinks it is currently
      10:00:22, the receiving server must not reject the data submission.  As
      we develop and roll out the time synchronization scheme for the USS
      Network, we will add appropriate validation requirements to the API
      documentation.
      3. On the contrary, times must be validated for consistency within a
      given data submission.  For example, if a server states that it sends
      a data instance at 10:00:23 and one of the other data elements states
      that a measurement was performed at 10:00:24, then the receiving server
      must reject that data submission. Some of these checks are explictly
      stated in the descriptions below. If you recognize any such checks that
      are not documented, please submit an issue report on github.
      4. These token SUBJECT validations are required for security.
      For PUT Operation to modify an existing operation, the token SUBJECT claim upon modification MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial Operation.
      For PUT Message associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Message MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency messages.
      For PUT Position associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Position MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed only if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency position reports.

  timestamp:
    description: >-
      Timestamps MUST follow the guidance set forth in RFC3339.
      This RFC defines a profile for ISO8601 forcused on interoperability of Internet
      based systems.  This profile makes certain design decisions based on
      reducing rarely used options, elimination of redundant information, and
      overall simplicity.

      From these goals and insight from building interoperable systems,
      RFC3339 provides a grammar for timestamps.  Please see

      https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6

      for that grammer and the sections preceding that grammar for more
      detailed discussion.

      For UTM, we have attempted to reduce the grammar to a regular expression,
      but this does not take into account all rules.  For example, a valid
      timestamp should not allow 30 days in February, but this is not in the
      regular expression.  Likewise, leap years are not captured in the
      regular expression.  Thus it is possible for a timestamp to satisfy this
      RE, but still not be valid and, thus, be rejected by some components of
      UTM.

      Note that this UTM format specifies millisecond precision for all
      time stamps.  This is why the min and max length are fixed at 24.

      Note that this UTM format specifies UTC time indicated by a trailing 'Z'.

      Note taht this UTM format specifies date and time separation with a 'T'.

  uuid:
    description: >-
      Currently, this is a UUID version 4.  These UUIDs have a well-defined
      regular expression.  However, beyond meeting the regular expression,
      there is an expectation that the numbers are generated appropriately
      in terms of the approach to psuedo-random number generation.  More
      details in the USS Specification document in this regard.

      UUIDs are used in several models and serve as primary keys in many cases.

      In all cases, unless otherwised specified, UUIDs are generated by a
      USS (or FIMS) prior to sending to another USS (or FIMS). Thus one
      entity does not add data elements (like a UUID primary key) to data
      originating from another entity.

      If ordering or sorting is required, the sort order is lexicographic as
      defined in RFC4122:

      UUIDs, as defined in this document, can also be ordered
      lexicographically.  For a pair of UUIDs, the first one follows the
      second if the most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is
      greater for the first UUID.  The second precedes the first if the
      most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for
      the second UUID.

          an operational system decides on the approach to discovery.

          For Gridded USS Discovery, this should be an x,y,z string where
          x and y are the coords of the grid and z is the zoom level.  For
          example:  "110,117,10"

          For FIMS Discovery, this should be the uss_instance_id which is a

      submit_time:
        description: >-
          Time that this Operation was first announced to the USS Network in any
          way.  For GUD, this means when you first write to the grid.  For
          traditional discovery, this means the first time you announce to your
          LUN.

          The submit_time value MUST remain constant for each recipient of the announcement
          since this value is potentially part of a signature of the Operation
          plan in some cases.  So, when data (or references to the data) are
          written to the grid, the same data are to be sent, as required, to
          other stakeholders (e.g. other USSs).  This means that if there is a
          500ms difference in the time that you send and get confirmation from
          the grid, you DO NOT update the submit_time when sending to the USSs
          after that.
          When the operation is announced for the first time, update_time MUST be equal to submit_time.
          When an operation is modified (updated), update_time MUST be greater than submit_time.

          Similarly, for traditional discovery, if there is a delay in sending
          the data to one LUN member versus another, this field is NOT updated
          in between as we want each stakeholder to ultimately receive the same
          data and (potentially) the same signature of the data.

        example: '2015-08-20T14:11:56.118Z'
      update_time:
        description: >-
          A timestamp set by the USS any time the state of the operation is
          updated within the USS Network. An update may be minor or major, but
          if/when te Operation is shared in the USS Network as a PUT to its LUN,
          update_time must reflect the time that update was provided.

          When the operation is announced for the first time, update_time MUST be equal to submit_time.
          When an operation is modified (updated), update_time MUST be greater than submit_time.
          THe update_time value MUST be constant for each update data exchange.

          This means that all stakeholder systems have the same value for
          update_time even if, for example, one USS receives the
          update later than others due to HTTP retrys or is provided as a GET
          for this Operation.  This field is set and maintained by the USS
          managing the Operation and is communicated to other USSs.

          0. PROPOSED
            This operation is not yet ACCEPTED.  It may be awaiting information
            from the operator, it may be in conflict with another ACCEPTED or
            ACTIVATED operation and undergoing a negotiation process, or for
            some other reason it is not yet able to be declared ACCEPTED.
          1. ACCEPTED
            This operation has been deemed ACCEPTED by the supporting USS. This
            implies that the operation meets the requirements for operating in
            the airspace based on the type of operation submitted.
          2. ACTIVATED
            This operation is active. The transition from ACCEPTED to ACTIVATED
            is not an announced transition. The transition is implied based on
            the submitted start time of the operation (i.e. the
            effective_time_begin of the first OperationVolume). Note that an
            ACTIVATED operation is not necessarily airborne, but is assumed
            to be "using" the OperationVolumes that it has announced.
          3. CLOSED
            This operation is closed. It is not airborne and will not become
            airborne again. If the UAS and the crew will fly again, it would
            need to be as a new operation. A USS may announce the closure of any
            operation, but is not required to announce unless the operation was
            ROGUE or NONCONFORMING.
          4. NONCONFORMING
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.
          5. ROGUE
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.

          If ordering of states is required for any purpose, they shall be

          A note on "intersection":
            Note 2: All of the terms "crosses", "within", "touches" imply
            intersection. I can track down a source for this definition
            (probably OGC), but for now, you can see it illustrated in the
            description for PostGIS intersection:
              https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html

          Validation of the array must include the following checks:
            1. The array of operation volumes MUST have minimum length of 1.
            2. The array of operation volumes MUST have maximum length of 250.
            3.  Each operation volume MUST have non-zero 4D volume
              (i.e. each of the 4 dimensions much be > 0 in magnitude).
            4. Volume intersection must pass the following checks:
              a. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have a 2D or 3D intersection in 3D space with its immediately
              preceding operation volume.  Note that a 2D intersection in 3D
              space implies two volumes that "touch" and the intersection has 2D
              area.  Sharing just an edge would not qualify.  3D volumes that
              don't touch at all would not qualify, even if they would intersect
              when projected into 2D space (e.g. if "looking down" on the two
              volumes).
              b. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have a non-negative temporal intersection with its
              immediately preceding operation volume (Note we'd calculate this
              by t1-t2 where t1 is the preceding operation volume end time and
              t2 is the succeeding operation volume start time.).
              c. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have either a non-zero volume (3D) intersection OR a positive
              temporal intersection. (Note this is a logical "OR" so it may have
               both intersection types... i.e. it is not an "exclusive OR").
            5. Each spatial dimension of an op vol's bounding box must have
            length less than 6000ft (should discuss with partners this value).
            This is a sanity check against excessively large volumes. Need to
            be careful here as there may be legitimate use cases wherein large
            volumes are required/allowed, but we want to encourage efficient
            planning and protect against misuse of the shared airspace.
            6. The planned duration of an op vol must be less than 120 minutes. Again,
            need to be careful to not damage legitimate use cases, but need to
            protect against misuse/poor planning. For long duration missions,
            it may be reasonable to have them replan or to have volumes with
            the same geog and long time values that slightly intersect.
            7. The start time of an operation volume other than the first in the
            array must be greater than or equal to the start time of its
            immediately preceding operation volume.
            (note this probalby should be #4 or so, bumping the others down,
            but I didn't want to cause confusion in case implementers are
            referencing these checks somewhere by number.)

      In relation to a UTMMessage, the severities may be interpreted as follows.
      1. **EMERGENCY**
        There is an *immediate* impact to the safety of other air operations,
        the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground.
        Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      2. **ALERT**
        There may be an impact to the safety of other air operations, the
        safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to
        mitigate required by other operations.
      3. **CRITICAL**
        Without mitigations by the affected operation, the situation may rise to
         an emergency in the near future.
      4. **WARNING**
        There is a contained issue that may result in the loss of aircraft. No
        immediate or likely effect to other operations, people on the ground,
        or structures.
      5. **NOTICE**
        This issue is provided for situational awareness. Planning by operators
        and USSs may be affected.

          polygon should be large enough to provide high confidence (for some
          TBD value of "high") that the vehicle will land within it, but
          hopefully be no larger (for some TBD value of hopefully).

          If LOITERING, this is the polygon the UA will stay within at the
          loiter_altitude.

          this Contingency versus any other within the set of Contingency for
          this operation. This may be thought of as a ranking of the potential
          landing sites with all other factors being held equal, though dynamic
          conditions will likely play a role in adjusting this ranking in real
          time by the USS or Operator.  For example, one Contingency may be
          significantly further from the operation at a given time and, thus,
          would be less preferred than it might be otherwise. Further
          interpretation of this field is left to the operator and USS.
