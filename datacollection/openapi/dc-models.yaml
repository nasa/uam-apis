        all relevant Entities.

            State of an Operation.

            'Accepted': This Operation was fully deconflicted from other Entities at the time it changed to this
            state, but no aircraft associated with it are active yet.  The create or update request for this
            Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

            'Activated': One or more aircraft associated with this Operation are, or will imminently be, in
            flight.  The create or update request for this Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for
            all relevant Entities.

            'NonConforming': This Operation is outside of the planned volume.  The new or updated volumes MUST
            contain the actual position of the aircraft.  In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityuuid}/telemetry'
            USS-USS endpoint should respond, if available, to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request
            for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and
            cannot necessarily deconflict.

            'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been
            NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must
            transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.
            In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityuuid}/telemetry' USS-USS endpoint should respond, if available,
            to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request for this Operation may omit a Key in this
            case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

            'Ended': This Operation has ended (due to either an Operator-induced change or flight completion).

            Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

            all relevant Entities.

            contain the actual position of the aircraft.  In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityuuid}/telemetry'

            for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and
            cannot necessarily deconflict.

            'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been
            NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must
            transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.

            case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

                Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

                flight.  The create or update request for this Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for
                all relevant Entities.

                for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and
                cannot necessarily deconflict.

                'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been
                NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must
                transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.

                case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

                    'Accepted': This Operation was fully deconflicted from other Entities at the time it changed to this
                    state, but no aircraft associated with it are active yet.  The create or update request for this
                    Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

                    'Activated': One or more aircraft associated with this Operation are, or will imminently be, in
                    flight.  The create or update request for this Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for
                    all relevant Entities.

                    'NonConforming': This Operation is outside of the planned volume.  The new or updated volumes MUST
                    contain the actual position of the aircraft.  In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityuuid}/telemetry'
                    USS-USS endpoint should respond, if available, to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request
                    for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and
                    cannot necessarily deconflict.

                    'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been
                    NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must
                    transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.

                    case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

                            State of an Operation.

                            'Accepted': This Operation was fully deconflicted from other Entities at the time it changed to this
                            state, but no aircraft associated with it are active yet.  The create or update request for this
                            Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

                            'Activated': One or more aircraft associated with this Operation are, or will imminently be, in
                            flight.  The create or update request for this Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for
                            all relevant Entities.

                            'NonConforming': This Operation is outside of the planned volume.  The new or updated volumes MUST
                            contain the actual position of the aircraft.  In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityuuid}/telemetry'
                            USS-USS endpoint should respond, if available, to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request
                            for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and
                            cannot necessarily deconflict.

                            'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been
                            NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must
                            transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.
                            In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityuuid}/telemetry' USS-USS endpoint should respond, if available,
                            to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request for this Operation may omit a Key in this
                            case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

                            'Ended': This Operation has ended (due to either an Operator-induced change or flight completion).
